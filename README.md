# Ethical Audit Dashboard – NHANES Diabetes Data

This project is part of a personal initiative to explore fairness and subgroup disparities in diabetes diagnosis and care using U.S. NHANES data. The goal is to build a dashboard that makes it easy to see how race, gender, income, immigration status, and other social factors might influence who gets diagnosed, treated, or monitored for diabetes.

Right now, I'm working on:
- Cleaning and selecting meaningful variables from the demographics and diabetes modules
- Renaming and simplifying feature names
- Identifying missing values and patterns across subgroups

This repo includes:
- `raw_data.py`: Cleaning and exploration logic
- `Data/`: Raw NHANES files (.xpt format)

Next steps:
- Handle missing values
- Explore trends by subgroup (race, sex, income, etc.)
- Build an interactive dashboard using Streamlit or another tool

Data source: National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES)  
Years used: 2017–2018 cycle (cycle J)

Project will evolve over time — currently in the early analysis phase.
